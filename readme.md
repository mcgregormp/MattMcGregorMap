For this project I couldnt find any shapefiles that would load in geojson so I just used the base templete that you gave us for the lab and put my own spin on it. I really liked the location of Asheville its one of my favorite places in North Carolina and me and my girlfriend will be visiting and spending a few days there just camping out and going to breweries. I find information like this helpful and so by editing the lab into my own version I get a look at where the closest AirBNBs are. Some of the changes I made where font, font size, location of the legend and scale, I changed the color scale from 5 to 3 and made it red. I hope that in the future I get better at this and so that way I can use my knowledge gained in this class to help me create maps that interest me and are also helpful.
